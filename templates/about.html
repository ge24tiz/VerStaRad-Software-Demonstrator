    <h1>Wheel-Rail Wear Prediction of Stacker Crane</h1>
    <p>
      This VerStaRad software demonstrator is dedicated to providing a one-step online service 
      for predicting wear behavior of wheel-rail contact system of stacker cranes. By using machine 
      learning models, users can quickly obtain predicted wear depths for front wheel, rear wheel
      and rail simply by inputting structural parameters and operational conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Problem Statement:</h2><br>
      The rapid growth of e-commerce and the acceleration of globalization have posed significant
      challenges to the logistics industry. The increasing volume of goods throughput inevitably 
      places higher demands on the reliability of warehousing equipment. As one of the core devices
      in internal logistics, the stacker crane provides automated storage and retrieval operations
      and is widely used in various types of warehouses. As a rail-guided material handling system, 
      its overall reliability depends heavily on its wheel-rail contact system.<br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      In recent years, system failures due to wear have emerged as an urgent issue needing solution.
      For stacker cranes, higher payloads and increased operating speeds further amplify the dynamic
      loads on the wheel-rail system, causing severe wear. Wear results in material loss, alters 
      wheel and rail profiles, and degrades contact conditions. This degradation leads to impact
      loads and vibrations that adversely affect the performance and lifespan of the entire system.<br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      Currently, there are no design standards specifically addressing wheel-rail wear for stacker cranes. 
      As a result, maintenance practices rely on empirical guidelines and manufacturer recommendations,
      offering little in the way of tailored solutions for individual machines or actual operating conditions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Solutions:</h2><br>
      We achieve efficient and accurate wear prediction through the following workflow:<br>
      <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
      <strong> Parameter Identification:</strong><br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      In collaboration with several stacker crane manufacturers and through in-depth expert interviews, 
      we identified the key factors and their valid ranges, that influence wheel-rail wear behavior. These
      include the design and operating parameters of stacker cranes, and warehouse conditions.<br>
      <div style="height: 15px;"></div>
      <strong> Numerical Simulation:</strong><br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      We developed a parameterized single-mast stacker crane model in the multibody dynamics software
      Simpack. Using the Hertzian contact theory and the Archard wear model from Simpack Rail module, we 
      quantitatively compute wear under any specified parameter configuration.<br>
      <div style="height: 15px;"></div>
      <strong> Sensitivity Analysis:</strong><br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      Applying the Morris screening method, we performed a global sensitivity analysis on the parameters
      identified in step 1. This allowed us to highlight which factors have the most significant impact 
      on wear behavior.<br>
      <div style="height: 15px;"></div>
      <strong> Parameter Sampling:</strong><br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      We used our developed genetic-Latin hypercube sampling algorithm to generate a uniformly distributed
      sample plan over the influential parameters. This approach minimized the number of required simulations 
      while thoroughly covering the parameter space.<br>
      <div style="height: 15px;"></div>
      <strong> Simulation Experiments:</strong><br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      An automated simulation pipeline runs the sample plan from step 4. The results produce a comprehensive
      dataset for model training.<br>
      <div style="height: 15px;"></div>
      <strong> Predictive Models:</strong><br>
      <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
      After testing a variety of machine learning algorithms, we selected Support Vector Regression (SVR) for
      wheel wear and XGBoost for rail wear prediction. In validation tests, the prediction accuracy achieved
      above 92%. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the main page, you can enter real or normalized parameter values along with
      the 'cycles' to see how much the model predicts the wear might be. If cycles
      is a multiple of 100, the wear predictions are scaled proportionally.
